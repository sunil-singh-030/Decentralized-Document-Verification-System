ðŸš€ What is Web3.Storage?
Web3.Storage is a service that lets you store files on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) easily using a simple API. It takes care of uploading, pinning, and retrieving your files â€” all in a decentralized and browser-friendly way.

ðŸ”§ How it Works (in short):
You upload a file using JavaScript (e.g., from a web app).

Web3.Storage generates a CID (Content Identifier) for that file.

Your file is stored on IPFS + Filecoin, and can be accessed via public gateways (like https://CID.ipfs.w3s.link/).

ðŸ§  Why Use It?
No need to run your own IPFS node

Safe to use in frontend (API key, no secret)

Automatically pins files (they wonâ€™t disappear)

Works with any file: PDFs, images, JSON, etc.

Ideal for dApps, NFT metadata, certificate storage (like your InstaVerify)

ðŸ”— Example:
js
Copy code
const client = new Web3Storage({ token: 'YOUR_API_TOKEN' });
const cid = await client.put([file]);
console.log('CID:', cid); // Use this CID to access file from IPFS
âœ… Summary:
Web3.Storage = Easiest way to store files on IPFS using JavaScript. Free, reliable, and perfect for web apps and blockchain projects.
